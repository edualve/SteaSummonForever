# Changelog

## 1.0.1 (2026-11-13)

- Fix a leftover debug print that spammed the next queued player's
  name to the chat log once per second while channeling a summon.

## 1.0.0 (2026-11-08)

First release for World of Warcraft: Forever, ported from
[SteaSummonSOD](https://github.com/edualve/SteaSummonSOD) v1.07.

### New

- **Trade chat advertising**: an Ad button on the summon window sends a
  configurable advertisement to the Trade channel (cities only), with a
  hard cooldown (default 5 minutes, configurable 1-30) that survives
  relogs. The button shows a live countdown while on cooldown.
  Configure the text and cooldown under Options -> Messages.

### Ported to the Forever client

- Interface 16001; all classic-era APIs the modern engine removed are
  shimmed (metadata, auras, spells, items, container, party management,
  options panel, menus, frame templates, font flags).
- Full support for Forever's first/last character names throughout the
  summon list, chat scanning, and network identity.
- Range, position, mana, connection, and death checks handle the modern
  client's secret values gracefully.
- Secure summon buttons work with the modern cast-on-keydown behavior.
- Soul shard counting works by item ID and includes a soul bag in the
  extra (reagent) bag slot.
- City whispers no longer read "to Thunder Bluff in Thunder Bluff".

### Fixed (pre-existing)

- "invite" auto-invite trigger never matched (only "inv" worked).
- Version display queried the wrong addon name.
- Debug toggle accidentally stored a table and could stick on.
